        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          First, let me introduce myself. My name is Vanessa Isabela Denny, and
          I am 29 years old. <em><strong>I was born and lived in Brazil</em></strong>
          all these years, and moved to Ottawa almost a month ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          After finishing high school, I entered college to study <em>Business
          Management</em> and developed myself in the administrative area for just
          over six years; during these years I was always curious and excited
          to study and do extra work related to Information Systems. So, I
          returned to college to study <em>Systems Analysis and Development</em> where I
          was selected to be a math tutor to help other students, and I had
          the opportunity to do internships in multinational companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my last job, I was able to gain experience with application
          development, where I stayed for two years and developed a new part of
          a bank mobile app based on projects by Customer Experience
          specialists. Working with them, I was able to understand the
          importance of analysis and research on interface design and user
          experience design, and in this exchange of knowledge I developed a
          great interest in learning more about design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, I started the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>
          program to continue sharpening my skills in the
          technology field and obtain great knowledge in design techniques and
          tools. Also, I am very interested to know the Canadian culture and
          improve my English skills, specially in communication.
        </p>

          One thing that I am passionate about is dancing. It is my 23<sup>th</sup>-year
          practicing this art, and I am looking forward to keep dancing here in Ottawa,
          ballet, jazz, and street dance. I was a professional dancer with scholarship
          in a company in Brazil for ten years and used to be a teacher for children, for
          no longer than five years and I had big challenges and opportunities like
          participating in a competition in Germany in 2015. It's something I don't really
          see myself getting away from for the rest of my life.

          A film biography I really enjoyed watching was about Stephen Hawking, who I believe
          has many wise teachings. One of the reflections that caught my attention the most was:
        </p>
      </article>
      <blockquote>
        Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you
        see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life
        may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't
        just give up. - <cite>Stephen Hawking</cite>
